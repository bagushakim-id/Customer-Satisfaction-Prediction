Customer Satisfaction Prediction
This project aims to predict customer satisfaction using machine learning models. We compared several classification models including AdaBoost, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, KNN, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest. We used Precision as the evaluation metric to assess the models' performance.

We used the following tools and libraries:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
pickle
json
warnings
scipy.stats
sklearn

The data was preprocessed using various techniques such as train-test split, column transformation, and scaling. We trained the models using a pipeline and optimized them using GridSearchCV. Finally, we evaluated the models using cross-validation and generated a confusion matrix, classification report, and other evaluation metrics.

Overall, this project demonstrates the effectiveness of various machine learning models in predicting customer satisfaction.
