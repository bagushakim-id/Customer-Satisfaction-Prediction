# Customer Satisfaction Prediction

The Customer-Satisfaction-Prediction Project is a data science project that aims to predict the level of customer satisfaction for air transportation (airline) using several classification models and evaluate prediction errors for customers who should not be included in the satisfied or neutral category, but are predicted as satisfied customers. Model evaluation is based on the precision metric, which shows the level of accuracy of the prediction results. By reducing the prediction error of actual dissatisfied or mediocre customers, companies can improve the customer experience and increase their satisfaction. This project involves the stages of data collection and cleaning, feature selection, and selection of classification models such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes. After building several models, the best one is selected based on its performance and predictive accuracy. Project Customer-Satisfaction-Prediction can assist air transportation companies in improving service quality and customer satisfaction.
