# Customer Satisfaction Prediction

This project aims to predict customer satisfaction using machine learning models. We compared several classification models including AdaBoost, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, KNN, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest. We used Precision as the evaluation metric to assess the models' performance.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- pickle
- json
- warnings
- scipy.stats
- sklearn

## Model Comparison and Evaluation
We preprocessed the data using various techniques such as train-test split, column transformation, and scaling. The models were trained using a pipeline and optimized using GridSearchCV. Finally, we evaluated the models using cross-validation and generated a confusion matrix, classification report, and other evaluation metrics.

## Conclusion
Overall, this project demonstrates the effectiveness of various machine learning models in predicting customer satisfaction. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to contact us. Thank you for visiting our project!
